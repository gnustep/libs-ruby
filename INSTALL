INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To have the full functionality, you need to install a shared
Objective-C runtime library; the libobjc provided with older gcc is
static.  Please refer to the GNUstep website for more information on
installing a shared libobjc.

1) Make sure you have gnustep installed (optionally but strongly
   recommended - with a shared libobjc - such as the gnustep-objc),
   and that it is working.
   
2) Make sure your java environment is well configured.  
   At least one of the following should be true: 
  
  * typing 'ruby' at the shell prompt should run the ruby interpreter
  (ie, you have set up your PATH environment variable);



3) Compile RIGS: 

    make 

4) Install RIGS: Become root, then type:

    make install

5) Play with RIGS.  The best place to start is the Examples
   and Testing directory.

I hope you'll have as much fun programming GNUstep from Ruby as I had when writing RIGS.
