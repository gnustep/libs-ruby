FirstApp is a sample GNUstep Application written in Ruby. It has been written to show how easy it is to write nice looking GNUstep application with RIGS.

There is also a GNUmakefile (and GNUmakefile.postamble) showing how to
use the GNUstep makefile system to make and install an application
written in Ruby as if it was an ObjC application.

Once you have installed this sample application with "make install"
you can transparently open your GNUstep application written in Ruby as
usual with:

openapp FirstApp.app

Enjoy! Feedback and contribution are welcome.
